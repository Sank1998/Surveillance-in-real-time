LoRa (short for long range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology.LoRa devices and wireless radio frequency technology (LoRa Technology) is a long range, low power wireless platform that has become the de facto technology for Internet of Things (IoT) networks worldwide. LoRa Technology and the open LoRaWANÂ® protocol enable smart IoT applications that solve some of the biggest challenges facing our planet: energy management, natural resource reduction, pollution control, infrastructure efficiency, disaster prevention, and more.
